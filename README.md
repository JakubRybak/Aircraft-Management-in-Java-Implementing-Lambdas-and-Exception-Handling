Advanced Java OOP Project with Lambdas
Project Overview
This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, focusing on encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, with additional emphasis on functional programming via lambda expressions and functional interfaces. The project models an airport system with different types of aircraft, each with specific properties and behaviors, and includes complex actions such as sorting and filtering based on certain criteria.

Technologies and Concepts Used
Java – Core language for project development.
OOP Principles – Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism are foundational to the class hierarchy and behavior.
Lambda Expressions – Lambdas are used to create concise implementations of functional interfaces for operations on collections and data.
Functional Interfaces – Custom functional interfaces used for flexible data generation.
Java Collections – Lists and other collection utilities to store and manage the fleet of aircraft.
Custom Exceptions – User-defined exceptions for error handling specific to aircraft boarding and loading processes.
Java Streams API – Used to handle data manipulation, filtering, and sorting in a functional style.
